Now that you are a fabulous new student in the Flatiron Summer Program, it's not too early to start planning your graduation!  Today, you're going to write your own invitation for your graduation, but not just yours, you are going to use the CLI to allow anybody in the class to build a graduation invitation! This CLI app will take in input from the user, and then use that input to create a fully formed graduation invitation.

You will need to combine all of the different skills your have learned today to complete this challenge such as:
+  Capturing user input from the CLI
+  Using variables to store information
+  Using String Interpolation to integrate variables into strings
+  Using string methods to manipulate strings to fit specific formats

####Directions

1.  You need to get user input for this so you'll need to use the CLI to get that.  Think about what we use to capture user input and how we store information in Ruby.

2.  Next, you'll need to update the following graduation invitation. There are three places where you'll replace text with input from your user about their graduation ceremony. 

```
grad_invitation = "The family of insert_your_name proudly invite you to their graduation commencement on insert_date_here. Festivities will be held at insert_location_there See you then!"

```
3.  Finally given how unpredictable user input can be, think about what string methods you can use to clean up and properly format the user input for your invitation.
