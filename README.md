Now that you are a fabulous new student in the Flatiron Summer Program, it's not too early to start planning your gradutation!  Today, you're going to write your own invitation for your graduation, but not just yours, you are going to use the CLI to allow anybody in the class to build a graduation invitation!

You will need to combine all of the different skills your have learned today to complete this challenge such as:
+  Capturing user input from the CLI
+  Using variables to store information
+  Using String Interpolation to integrate variables into strings
+  Using string methods to manipulate strings to fit specific formats

####Directions

1.  You need to get user input for this so you'll need to use the CLI to get that.  Think about what we use to capture user input and how we store information in Ruby.
2.  Next, you'll need to adapt the Weasley invitation to fit your needs for a Flatiron Invitation.  Feel free to cut and paste from the other lab and then adapt it to your new lab.
3.  Finally given how unpredictable user input can be, think about what string methods you can use to clean up and properly format the user input for your invitation.
